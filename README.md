# Song-Ranker
Song Ranker is Python Web application that uses an ELO rating system to rank songs. Users sign in and select their favorite artists. They are then repeatedly prompted to select their preffered betweeen two randomly chosen songs. Over time the ELO algorithm turns this data into a song ranking. Users can choose to look at as many different artists as they like, as well as filter out albums they do not know from a specific artist.

Planned updates:
* Connect directly to your Spotify account
* Compare between songs of different artists
* Connect and compare your rankings with other friends accounts
